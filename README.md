#Project Overview
This project consists of a web-based application that reads Rich Site Summaries. In it's original state, it included Jasmine and an initial test suite! These tests were added to ensure:

1) The name and URL for each feed are not blank or missing
2) The menu element is hidden automatically and switches between open and close when ticked
3) The starter feeds loaded are unique and are not duplicates, using different time testing methods
